## AIOChroma

**AIOChroma** is an API wrapper for communication with Razer Chroma devices.

Up till now, it is mostly used for the [custom Chroma integration for Home Assistant](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/ha-chroma). But you are welcome to use it for your purposes, as well as suggest new features which you would like to use.

A short presentation of the features can be found in this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytdS9JUWSb4).

## Installation

Installation of the latest release is available from PyPI:

```
pip install aiochroma
```

## Usage

This section is still under development.

## Supported devices

This list provides only the models tested by me or other users.

Some of the devices might be in the group which you would not expect. This is not related to the integration but to the Chroma SDK.
